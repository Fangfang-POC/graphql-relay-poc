This repos uses styleguidist to generate the demo documentation [docs](https://fangfang-poc.github.io/graphql-relay-poc/)
## graphql introduction
From [graphql website](https://graphql.org/learn/)
GraphQL is a query language for your API, and a server-side runtime for executing queries using a type system you define for your data. GraphQL isn't tied to any specific database or storage engine and is instead backed by your existing code and data.
## Local development
- `yarn download:schema` to download the schema from the remote server 
- `yarn install`
- `yarn start`
- view the Demo on `http://localhost:6068`

## Structure
`src/UserComponent.tsx` is the demo of fragments composition.
